# 🌍 COVID-19 Data Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview

This project provides a visual and analytical comparison of COVID-19 cases and vaccination progress across some selected countries such as: **Cuba**, **India**, and **Zimbabwe**. It uses real-world data to surface patterns, trends, and insights into how different nations handled the pandemic.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Compare total COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates across selected countries.
- Identify and visualize anomalies and trends over time.
- Enable interactivity for deeper exploration using widgets and charts.
- Stretch: Include optional ICU/hospitalization data and geographic visualizations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for static visualizations
- **Plotly Express** – for interactive charts
- **GeoPandas** – for choropleth maps
- **ipywidgets** – for dropdown and interactive filters
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive analysis

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ellah-ui/week8pythonassignment.git

2. If requirements.txt is not present, manually install key libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly  ipywidgets

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook

4. Run
   ```bash
   week8pythonassignment.ipynb

## 💡 Insights & Reflections
a. India has the highest total number of cases, showing a prolonged and widespread outbreak.

b. Cuba showed a rapid vaccine rollout, suggesting strong local production and public health mobilization.

c. Zimbabwe has low reported cases and vaccinations, likely influenced by underreporting or access issues.

d. Interactive tools like choropleth maps and dropdowns add value for exploring country-specific data.
